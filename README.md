	VERSION...................: 0.1 a
	
	DESCRIPCION:
	
	dotFill is a little function with the objective
	of print dots between 2 text pieces. The idea is
	to format the output of info putting the dots
	after the first column and X tabs after, in the
	next column. Like the spaces number can be different
	the dots filled the different distance.

	sample:
	
	The dots are filling diferent number of spaces. 
	That is dotFill function.

TO DO:

I´m implemmentanding a 3rd way to show the dots, progresively.
At the moment, there are 2 ways:

  - Write print with tabs (\t)
	- Tabs are expanded (4 spaces in each TAB)
	-  Replace two spaces to two dots (Space between words doesn´t replace)

  - Write dots next to col limit (The best WAY at the moment)
	- Doesn´t matter the long of words. While exist space to print dots
		next to a limit what you decide, the dots will be print


  - Progressively print (IN CONSTRUCTION. EXPERIMENTAL!!!)
	- Dots are printed at screen one by one like a progress bar.
